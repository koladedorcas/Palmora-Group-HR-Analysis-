## Bonus Calculation Logic

| Rating       | Bonus % |
|--------------|---------|
| Very Good    | 20%     |
| Good         | 10%     |
| Average      | 5%      |
| Poor         | 0%      |
| Not Rated    | 0%      |

## DAX Calculations
```DAX
Bonus Amount = Salary * LOOKUPVALUE('BonusRules'[Bonus %], 'BonusRules'[Rating], Rating)
Total Compensation = Salary + Bonus Amount
